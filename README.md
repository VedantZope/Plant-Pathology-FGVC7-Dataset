Applied Transfer Learning using pre trained ResNet50 model along with Data Augmentations, identified inherit imbalance in dataset and tackled it by implementing custom loss function that assigns appropriate weights to classes. 
Tackled Dataset Imbalance problem by implementing custom loss function that assigns appropriate weights to classes.
